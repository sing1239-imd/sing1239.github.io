Interactive gallery was very interesting project for me because,I learned how to work with java and css together.
The layout of output is very simple there are 12 images in the grid which is one of the requirement. 
In desktop view there is grid of 4*3 and in tablet view there is grid of 6*2  and in mobile view there is row of 12 images.
Firstly,i faced some issues in width convertion to different views through media queries. Then i used 
flex command to adjust the grid in different views like desktop to tablet and then mobile.
Last thing in which i had issue was javascript beacuse i am not familier with javaScript So, i found my solution from content of previous classes.
The images which i used in interactive  gllery was clicked by me. These are not downloaded from any website.
I learned manythings while working on this project, same technique we can use in any website to make gallery view more intresting and convenient.
